# Welcome to NetTraceX! üöÄ

We're excited to announce the launch of **NetTraceX**, a comprehensive network diagnostic toolkit built with Go, featuring a beautiful terminal user interface powered by the Bubble Tea framework.

<!-- truncate -->

## What is NetTraceX?

NetTraceX is a modern network diagnostic tool that combines the power of traditional command-line network utilities with an intuitive terminal user interface. Built with clean architecture principles and extensive testing, it provides a unified experience for network troubleshooting and analysis.

## Key Features

### üåê Comprehensive Network Tools
- **Ping**: Test network connectivity with customizable parameters
- **Traceroute**: Trace network paths with multiple protocols
- **DNS Lookup**: Query DNS records with multiple record types
- **WHOIS**: Look up domain registration information
- **SSL Certificate Analysis**: Check SSL certificates and chains

### üé® Beautiful Terminal Interface
Powered by the Bubble Tea framework, NetTraceX provides:
- Intuitive keyboard navigation
- Real-time result display
- Responsive design for different terminal sizes
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### üîß Extensible Plugin System
- Clean architecture with SOLID principles
- Easy extension with custom diagnostic tools
- Plugin configuration management
- Integration with external services

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nettracex/nettracex-tui.git
cd nettracex

# Build the application
go build -o bin/nettracex ./cmd/nettracex

# Run the application
./bin/nettracex
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Ping a host
nettracex ping google.com

# Trace route
nettracex traceroute github.com

# DNS lookup
nettracex dns google.com

# Interactive mode
nettracex interactive
```

## Architecture

NetTraceX follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic interfaces and types
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Network clients and external integrations
- **Presentation Layer**: TUI components and user interface

### SOLID Principles Implementation

- **Single Responsibility**: Each interface and type has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Plugin architecture allows extension without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: All implementations can be substituted for their interfaces
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces for different concerns
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

## What's Next?

We have exciting plans for NetTraceX:

- **Plugin Marketplace**: Community-contributed diagnostic tools
- **Advanced Analytics**: Network performance metrics and trends
- **Integration APIs**: REST and GraphQL APIs for external integration
- **Cloud Sync**: Configuration and result synchronization
- **Mobile App**: Companion mobile application for remote monitoring
